## Overview

This project provides a production-ready schematic for a high-performance DSP audio interface utilizing the Texas Instruments TMS320C6657 digital signal processor (DSP), Micron MT41K512M16 DDR3L memory, and Texas Instruments TAC5212 audio codec. The design supports stereo 3.5mm TRS input/output for professional audio applications, such as real-time audio processing, effects, or recording interfaces. The schematic is generated using SKiDL, a Python-based hardware description library, and outputs a KiCad-compatible schematic file (`production_dsp_schematic.kicad_sch`).

**Key Features:**
- **DSP**: TMS320C6657 with dual C66x cores, supporting high-performance signal processing.
- **Memory**: 512Mb x16 DDR3L (MT41K512M16) for fast data buffering and processing.
- **Audio Codec**: TAC5212 with stereo ADC/DAC, supporting high-fidelity audio up to 192kHz/24-bit.
- **I/O**: Stereo 3.5mm TRS jacks for line-level input and output.
- **Configuration**: I2C interface for codec control.
- **Power Management**: Multiple voltage rails (1.0V, 1.5V, 1.8V, 3.3V) with hardware-enforced sequencing via PMIC.
- **ESD Protection**: TVS diodes on audio I/O for robustness.
- **Debugging**: JTAG interface for DSP programming and debugging.
- **Signal Integrity Enhancements**: DDR3 impedance tuning (PTV15), series terminations, ferrite beads for EMI suppression, and localized decoupling.

**Important Note: Work in Progress**  
This project is actively under development and considered a work in progress (WIP). While the schematic addresses core functionality and key signal integrity requirements, ongoing iterations include full PCB layout, firmware development, SI simulations (e.g., HyperLynx for DDR3 eye diagrams), and hardware validation. Contributions, feedback, and testing are encouraged to refine the design. Current version incorporates critical fixes (e.g., power sequencing, PTV15 calibration) but may require adjustments based on prototype results. Refer to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (to be added) for version history.

**Note**: The TMS320C6657 does not include a built-in USB controller. For USB connectivity, an external controller (e.g., TUSB2046) must be added, which is outside the scope of this schematic.

### PCB Layout Guidelines
- **DDR3 Signal Integrity**:
  - Match trace lengths for DDR3 signals (DQ, DQS, CLK, address/control) within 50ps skew.
  - Use 50Ω characteristic impedance for DDR3 traces.
  - Enable on-die termination (ODT) via DDR_ODT0 pin.
  - Route DDR signals on inner layers with solid ground planes to minimize noise. Include thermal vias under BGA packages (U1, U2) for heat dissipation.
- **Power Integrity**:
  - Place decoupling capacitors (0.01μF, 0.1μF, 10μF) as close as possible to power pins (<5mm).
  - Use separate digital (DGND) and analog (AGND) ground planes, connected via a single 0Ω resistor (R_STAR).
- **Audio I/O**:
  - Route audio traces (GUITAR_IN_L/R, AUDIO_OUT_L/R) away from high-speed digital signals (>10mm separation).
  - Ensure TVS diodes (D2, D3, D4) and ferrite beads (FB3, FB4) are placed near connectors to protect against ESD and EMI.

**WIP Note**: PCB layout is in progress; initial prototypes will validate these guidelines.

## KiCad Routing Best Practices

This section outlines best practices for routing the PCB in KiCad, tailored to this project's high-speed DDR3 signals, mixed-signal audio paths, and power distribution. These guidelines draw from KiCad documentation, IEEE standards, JEDEC JESD79-3C for DDR3, and general PCB design principles (e.g., IPC-2221 for generic design and IPC-7351 for land patterns). The focus is on maintaining signal integrity (SI), minimizing electromagnetic interference (EMI), and ensuring power integrity. Always perform Design Rule Checks (DRC) and Electrical Rule Checks (ERC) in KiCad, and validate with simulations (e.g., HyperLynx for SI).

### General Routing Principles in KiCad
- **Layer Stackup**: Use a minimum 4-layer board (signal/GND/power/signal) for noise isolation. For high-speed designs like this, prefer 6-8 layers to dedicate inner layers for DDR3 routing and ground planes. In KiCad's PCB Editor, define stackup via "Board Setup > Physical Stackup" to calculate impedance accurately.
- **Trace Width and Spacing**: Use KiCad's Trace Width Calculator (under "Tools") to determine widths based on current, temperature rise, and impedance (e.g., 50Ω for DDR3). For power traces, aim for widths supporting 1A/mm²; for signals, minimize to reduce capacitance.
- **Via Usage**: Prefer through-vias for signal transitions; use blind/buried vias for high-density areas. Minimize via stubs in high-speed paths to avoid reflections. In KiCad, set via sizes in "Board Setup > Design Rules > Net Classes".
- **Ground Planes**: Flood unused areas with ground fills (use "Zone" tool in PCB Editor). Stitch planes with vias every 10-15mm to reduce ground bounce. Separate DGND and AGND as noted, connecting only at R_STAR.
- **Net Classes and Design Rules**: Define net classes in "Board Setup > Design Rules > Net Classes" for DDR3 (e.g., 0.1mm width, 0.15mm clearance), audio (wider for low impedance), and power (thicker traces). Enforce rules for length matching and differential pairs.

### High-Speed Routing (DDR3-Specific)
DDR3 signals operate at up to 1333 MT/s, requiring controlled impedance and minimal skew to prevent reflections and timing errors (per TMS320C6657 Section 6.11 and JEDEC JESD79-3C).
- **Controlled Impedance**: Target 50Ω single-ended/100Ω differential. Use KiCad's Impedance Calculator to set trace widths (e.g., 0.127mm for 50Ω on FR4 with 0.2mm dielectric). Route differential pairs (CLKP/N, DQS0P/N, DQS1P/N) with equal lengths and consistent spacing.
- **Length Matching**: Match DQ/DQS within groups (<50ps skew, ~7.5mm length tolerance at 1333 MT/s) and address/control to CLK (<100ps). Use KiCad's "Tune Track Length" and "Tune Skew" tools in Interactive Router mode for meandering traces.
- **Routing Layers**: Route DDR3 on inner layers sandwiched between ground planes to shield from crosstalk. Avoid outer layers for high-speed signals to minimize EMI. Use "Push and Shove" router in KiCad for efficient placement.
- **Termination and Calibration**: Series terminations (34Ω placeholders in R_TERM) placed near U1 outputs; adjust via simulations. PTV15 (45.3Ω to ground) tunes driver impedance—route as a short, low-inductance trace.
- **Via Transitions**: Limit to 1-2 per signal; use back-drilling if stubs >1/20 wavelength (~3mm at 1GHz). Ground vias around signal vias for return paths.
- **Crosstalk Mitigation**: Maintain >3x trace width spacing between parallel traces. Orthogonal routing on adjacent layers reduces coupling.

### Mixed-Signal Routing (Audio and Digital)
This design combines high-speed digital (DDR3, McBSP0) with sensitive analog audio, requiring isolation to prevent digital noise from degrading audio quality (per TAC5212 datasheet and mixed-signal best practices).
- **Separation**: Physically separate analog (audio traces, codec) from digital (DDR3, I2C) sections by >10mm. Use ground pours or moats to isolate; in KiCad, draw zones with "Keep Out" rules for digital signals near analog areas.
- **Analog Routing**: Use differential pairs for audio inputs/outputs (IN1P/M, OUT1P/M) with matched lengths. Keep traces short (<50mm) and wide (0.5-1mm) for low impedance. Avoid vias in analog paths to minimize inductance.
- **Digital-Analog Interface**: Route McBSP0 (BCLK, FSYNC) with controlled lengths to match codec timing (≥40ns period). I2C lines (SCL/SDA) with 22Ω series resistors to damp ringing; keep <100mm to avoid capacitance issues.
- **EMI/EMC**: Ferrite beads (FB1-4) filter noise; place near entry points (e.g., FB3/4 near J2). Ground audio jacks (J2/J3) to AGND. Use KiCad's "RF Tools" for EMI analysis if available.
- **Power Routing**: Star-route power to analog sections from filtered rails (VCC_AUDIO via FB2). Decouple each pin (e.g., 0.01μF near AVDD) to suppress ripple.

**WIP Note**: These practices will be refined based on prototype testing and SI simulations. Community input on KiCad-specific workflows (e.g., plugins for impedance control) is welcome.
